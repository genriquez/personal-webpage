			<h3>IconFORGE</h3>
			
			<p>JavaScript-centric web application that allows inspecting an creating icon (.ico) files. With no relevant server-side logic, the app uses client-side binary file access APIs to read and write icon files. This project was intended to try out the then new version of the <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">JavascriptMVC framework</a>, as well as the latest file APIs implemented by Chrome and Firefox.</p>

			<h3>Canvas Mistify</h3>
			
			<p>A small spike trying out canvas-based rendering. Animation based on the old Windows screensaver Mistify (not an exact replica but an approximation). This project was also a test of separating most of the app logic into separate, independent modules (without using any third party libraries for dependency management such as require.js).</p>
